\section{Proof of Consistency}
Proof of consistency was used to test and prove that the code used to make sure the requirements were met.

\subsection{First Requirement}
The first requirement was to make sure that at least one door is closed at all times. To check if the requirement was met, a test was set up. The test involved looping through all the doors and setting their doorStatuses to open. The result was that  

\subsection{Second Requirement}
The second requirement was to ensure that the submarine could not perform any operations unless two doors were locked and closed.

\subsection{Third Requirement}
For the third requirement the submarine first had to have the ability to change depths. Secondly, the submarine had to ensure that when oxygen levels went below a certain threshold a warning will show. After this, the submarine has to re-surface after the oxygen is empty. 

\subsection{Fourth Requirement}
The fourth requirement instructed is that the submarine must surface if the nuclear reactor overheats. 

\subsection{Fifth Requirement}
Another requirement is that the submarine cannot dive beneath a certain depth.

\subsection{Sixth Requirement}
The last requirement was to make sure the submarine could load, store and fire torpedos safely.
