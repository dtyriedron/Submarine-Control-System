\section{Introduction}\label{submarine}
A submarine system was implemented using Ada and was proven by SPARK. The submarine system was implemented based on the following rules: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The submarine must have at least one airlock door closed at all times.
	\item The submarine can perform no operations unless both doors are closed and
	locked.
	\item If the oxygen runs out, the submarine has to surface.
	\item If the reactor overheats, the submarine has to surface.
	\item If the oxygen runs low, a warning must be shown.
	\item The submarine cannot dive beneath a certain depth.
	\item The submarine must be capable of storing, loading and firing torpedoes
	safely.
\end{itemize}

The system must carry out these requirements to a certain proven standard of SPARK. The system will aim to meet the platinum standard with all requirements covered.
