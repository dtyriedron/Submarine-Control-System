\section{Controller Structure}
The controller consists of many small parts. The first thing to do was to set the submarine to a record.

\subsection{First Requirement}
The first requirement was to make sure that at least one door is closed at all times. This was done by creating a Door record with a doorStatus variable attached to it to check if the door was either closed or open. A array of Doors was set up with a range of 2. The array of doors was then attached to the submarine as a variable.    

\subsection{Second Requirement}
The second requirement was to ensure that the submarine could not perform any operations unless two doors were locked and closed.

\subsection{Third Requirement}
For the third requirement the submarine first had to have the ability to change depths. Secondly, the submarine had to ensure that when oxygen levels went below a certain threshold a warning will show. After this, the submarine has to re-surface after the oxygen is empty. 

\subsection{Fourth Requirement}
The fourth requirement instructed is that the submarine must surface if the nuclear reactor overheats. 

\subsection{Fifth Requirement}
Another requirement is that the submarine cannot dive beneath a certain depth.

\subsection{Sixth Requirement}
The last requirement was to make sure the submarine could load, store and fire torpedos safely.
