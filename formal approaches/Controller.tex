\section{Controller Structure}

The submarine consisted of one air-locked door, an oxygen level indicator, a depth level indicator, reactor level indicator and a torpedo chamber. The separate components were put into different files to categorise the code.

The submarine file was the key file that brought all the other files together. It also contained code for the submarine's movement.

A file was created for the control of the doors of the submarine. This set up how the doors would behave and was included in the submarine file to be used to prevent any action occurring when both doors were not closed. 

Another file was created for the reactor which would control its temperature. It was included in the submarine file to be later called when the submarine increased in depth.

A file was created for the torpedo. It controlled the firing of torpedoes by setting up a chamber with two hatches. The process of firing a torpedo involved the opening of the outer hatch the firing of the torpedo and then the closing of the outer hatch. The process of loading the torpedo involved opening the inner hatch and then storing the torpedo.

A file was created for the control of the oxygen level. The oxygen level was decreased as the submarine increased in depth.
