\section{Conclusion}
To sum up the submarine system was fully implemented with some additional functionality. It was proved by SPARK to be of a platinum standard of code. However, the way the system outputted to a console was not very user engaging. This could be improved by printing the system output in a while loop every few seconds to give a more visual representation to the user that the system works and what the system actually does. This could be further enhanced by allowing the user to control the input of the submarine using keyboard controls within this while loop. The system could also be enhanced by improving certain post-conditions. The problem with the system's torpedo system is that the amount of torpedoes are not tracked. This could be enhanced by creating an integer to count the number of torpedoes that have been fired and making sure that integer is conditioned accordingly to make sure that the count is at the right number.
